* Data files manipulation (tag, series, karaokes)
* Config manipulation utilities
* Karaoke database generation and creation
* Gitlab issues functions
* Database initialization, access, and utilities
* Basic data types
* Other utilities : progress bar, constants, date and time, ffmpeg, files, object helps, logger, passport management, previews generation, validators, websockets...
* etc.
