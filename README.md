# Karaoke Mugen Shared Library

This is not a standalone project.

This is integrated as a git submodule into Karaoke Mugen App and Karaoke Mugen Server (and perhaps other projects) to provide a collection of utilities and functions common to all apps :

- Data files manipulation (tag, series, karaokes)
- Config manipulation utilities
- Karaoke database generation and creation
- Gitlab issues functions
- Database initialization, access, and utilities
- Basic data types
- Other utilities : progress bar, constants, date and time, ffmpeg, files, object helps, logger, passport management, previews generation, validators, websockets...
- etc.
